#What is Absenteeism?
Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation without good reason. Generally, absenteeism is unplanned absences.[1] Absenteeism has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an implicit contract between employee and employer. It is seen as a management problem, and framed in economic or quasi-economic terms. More recent scholarship seeks to understand absenteeism as an indicator of psychological, medical, or social adjustment to work.

#Problem Statement of the project 
The problem statement in this context is to address absenteeism at a company during work time. The business environment has become more competitive, leading to increased pressure in the workplace, which can raise people's stress levels. This stress, coupled with unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment, can have a negative impact on employees' health, potentially resulting in absenteeism from work.

#Main Goal
The main goal of the exercise is to predict whether an employee can be expected to be absent for a specific number of hours in a given workday. By having this information in advance, the company can reorganize the work process to avoid a lack of productivity and increase the quality of work generated. The exercise will delve into further analysis of the available data to develop a predictive model for absenteeism, potentially focusing on excessive absenteeism, and answer other relevant questions to support data-driven decision-making in managing workforce productivity and well-being.

#What is Absenteeism in the context of the problem statement?
The definition of absenteeism in this context is the absence from work during normal working hours, resulting in temporary incapacity to execute the regular working activity. The analysis aims to explore whether an employee presenting certain characteristics is likely to be away from work at some point in time or not. The data used to make these predictions include information about the employee's distance from the workplace, the number of children and pets they have, their education level, and other relevant factors.

#About the Dataset
The Dataset has the following key columns for 700 employees which will be used for the Business Intelligence Analysis

1. ID: An identifier for each record, likely represented as an integer or string data type.
2. Reason for Absence: A categorical variable representing various reasons for employee absenteeism, such as illness, personal reasons, or medical appointments. It                        might be stored as an integer or a string data type, depending on how it is encoded.
3. Date: The date of the absence, likely represented as a date or timestamp data type.
4. Absence Time in Hours: The duration of the absence in hours, typically stored as a numerical data type like float or integer.
5. Distance from Workplace: The distance between the employee's residence and the workplace, usually stored as a numerical data type, such as float or integer.
6. Number of Children and Pets: The number of children and pets an employee has, stored as integer values.
7. Higher Education: A binary variable indicating whether the employee has higher education (e.g., a degree), represented as a Boolean (True/False) or integer                           (0/1) data type.
